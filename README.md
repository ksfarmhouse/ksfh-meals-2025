# ksfh-meals-2025

This is the code behind the K-State FarmHouse meal website.

For Formatting, HTML and CSS are used.
For backend functions, C# is used.

The main areas you would work in is the Website project:
The wwwroot folder contains that css styling.
The Pages folder conains every page that is used in the website.

In the Shared Folder, there is a file called _Layout. This is the navigation bar that allows you to switch between pages.
The rest of the files in the Pages folder are for what is actually in each page.
